My name is Wassim, and I study Computer Science at Wayne State University. I write web applications using a variety of frameworks.

I've used several frameworks for both academic, side, and professional work. I like learning about, and experimenting with new web technologies, like Angular and Vue. However, my qualities go beyond technical skillset.

Besides work, I have lots of hobbies and interests. I love Aviation, catch up on the latest in the industry, and use a flight simulator.

I love Architecture and Civil Engineering, and watch many documentaries depicting the construction of symbolic skyscrapers. Additionally, I like photography (I took every photo on this website!).
