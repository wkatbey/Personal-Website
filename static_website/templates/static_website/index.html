          My name is Wassim, and I study Computer Science at Wayne State University. <br><br>I write web applications using a variety of frameworks. 
          I've used several frameworks for both academic, side, and professional work. I like learning about, and experimenting with new web technologies, 
          like Angular and Vue. However, my qualities go beyond technical skillset.<br><br>
          Besides work, I have lots of hobbies and interests. I love Aviation, catch up on the latest in the industry, and use a flight simulator.
          <br><br>I love Architecture and Civil Engineering, and watch many documentaries depicting the construction of symbolic skyscrapers.
          Additionally, I like photography (I took every photo on this website).

	          I'm a problem solver. I solve coding problems with a calm, cool attitude. I work on big projects, one problem at a time.
	          I admit ignorance and take a step back to evaluate my problem-solving methodology, in coding and in life.

                  Additionally, I'm an amateur photographer. I don't know much about photography. I only really use my iPhone to take photos. If I find I'm not satisfied with the quality of image I'm getting from my current collection, I will learn more photography. However, for the time being, this is outside my scope, as I'm currently devoted to software engineering.

                  As a software engineer in practice, I'm resposible for writing a script that is elegant, not just functional. A script that is structured, that can be understood through class dependency, self-documenting code, and so on. I like to make things I like look appealing.

                  There are several midtown/downtown areas within my backyard. In early May, 2018, I traveled outside my scope to New York City. I'm going to create an album of photos taken on that trip, 
                  and display them here.
